<h2>Dynamic Data - Neighbourhood Highlight</h2>
<div style="width: 800px; font-size: 14px">
  This example shows the power of the DataSet. Once a node is clicked, all nodes
  are greyed out except for the first and second order connected nodes. In this
  example we show how you can determine the order of connection per node as well
  as applying individual styling to the nodes based on whether or not they are
  connected to the selected node. The code doing the highlighting only takes
  about 1ms, the rest of the time is the redrawing of the network (9200
  edges..).
